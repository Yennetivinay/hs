## Our Vision  

Heal Paradise Village is a happy and harmonious learning community where staff and students feel safe and secure. School life is characterised by a calm, purposeful environment underpinned by relationships built on trust and mutual respect.  

Our expectation is that all students and staff will behave in appropriate and socially acceptable ways. Every member of staff has a key role in promoting and sustaining the highest standards of behaviour for learning.

- Speak politely to other people.  
- Have self-confidence and high self-esteem.  
- Take care of all school equipment and buildings.  
- Develop a good work ethic and a love for lifelong learning.

## Learning to Behave  

### 2.1 Providing a Safe and Supportive Environment  
The school aims to provide a safe, secure, and supportive environment where students can learn and teachers can teach. There is a direct link between the way young people learn and their behaviour. Staff at all levels play a key role in helping and encouraging students to understand socially acceptable and appropriate behaviour.  

### 2.2 Staff Expectations  
To encourage positive behaviour, staff will:  
- Model exemplary behaviour.  
- Treat all children and adults with respect.  
- Speak politely to each other.  
- Build student confidence and self-esteem through positive reinforcement.  
- Avoid using critical, sarcastic, loud, or bullying language.  
- Recognise student effort and achievements regularly and celebrate success.  
- Keep guardians and sponsors informed about success, efforts, and achievements.

## Challenging Unacceptable Behaviour  

### 2.3 Unacceptable Behaviours  
The following behaviours are not acceptable from students or staff:  
- Disrupting the learning of others.  
- Rude or inappropriate language.  
- Acts of aggression or physical violence.  
- Bullying or intimidation.  
- Racist, sexist, or homophobic comments.  
- Vandalism.  

### 2.4 Actions Taken for Unacceptable Behaviour  
If unacceptable behaviour occurs, staff will:  
1. Challenge the behaviour.  
2. Tell the student what is unacceptable and why.  
3. Explain how they could have behaved differently, modeling appropriate alternatives.  
4. Attempt to understand why the behaviour occurred.  

For repeated poor behaviour, sanctions will be applied. At no time will physical or unnatural punishment be used. Any staff member breaking this rule will face disciplinary action, which could lead to dismissal.

## Promoting Positive Behaviour  

### 3.1 Encouragement and Rewards  
The school recognises that students learn best in an environment where they feel safe, secure, and happy. This fosters a love of learning and encourages lifelong learning. Staff will provide daily rewards like ‘reward stickers’ or ‘merit points’ and periodically award prizes to encourage positive behaviours, including:  
- Diligent work, irrespective of ability.  
- Good behaviour in the classroom.  
- High standards of academic work.  
- Academic achievements relative to the student’s potential.  
- Artistic accomplishments.  
- Sporting achievements.  
- Musical and theatrical performances.  
- Acts of consideration and generosity.  
- Any other behaviour worthy of encouragement.

## Applying Sanctions  

### 4.1 Addressing Unacceptable Behaviour  
When a student displays unacceptable behaviour, sanctions may be applied after giving the student an opportunity to:  
- Explain their actions.  
- Understand the consequences of continued poor behaviour.  
- Understand why the sanction is applied.  

#### Possible Sanctions:  
- For disruptive behaviour, after three warnings: **5 minutes of reflection** standing alone in a corner.  
- Sent to the **Head Teacher** to explain their behaviour.  
- **15-minute detention**, writing about why their behaviour was unacceptable.  
- Exclusion from an enjoyable activity (e.g., a film night or picnic) and performing a **menial task**, such as picking up litter.

## Safeguarding the Students  

### 5.1 Ensuring Safety  
All aspects of student safety are paramount. To protect students from inappropriate materials over computer networks:  
- The **school firewall** is the first line of defence.  
- Staff may observe student computer screens during use.  
- If inappropriate material is suspected on a student’s computer or account, staff may inspect and delete it.  
  - **Note:** Real grounds for suspicion must be established before such action to maintain trust.
