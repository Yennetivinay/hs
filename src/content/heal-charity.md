# HEAL CHARITY

## HEAL Society
HEAL is a UK-registered charity, founded in 1992, with a commitment to providing shelter, support, education, and healthcare to over 1,000 children in India.

HEAL India was established in 1993 (registration number 138/1993). The charity’s first project began when its founder donated his family home, ‘Ankitha,’ in Guntur to HEAL India as an orphanage. Initially, this orphanage was home to 26 children for about five years, until HEAL Children’s Village was custom-built in a nearby village. Today, HEAL Children’s Village offers a home and healthcare center for 225 children with the support of 16 house mothers.

HEAL USA (2008), HEAL Australia (2014), HEAL Spain (2015), and HEAL Canada (2020) were subsequently established to expand the HEAL family, increase awareness, and encourage more people to contribute to this mission. Today, HEAL is an international charity with tax-exempt status in each of these countries. Run entirely by volunteers, HEAL has **no administration costs**, so donations go directly to projects.
