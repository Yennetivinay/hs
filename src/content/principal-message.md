# PRINCIPAL’S MESSAGE

Good day to one and all

> “If a child can’t learn the way we teach, maybe we should teach the way they learn.” – Ignacio Estrada

My sincere thanks to all the management members of the Heal School.

I strongly believe that each child blooms at his or her own pace. We just need to nurture them with human values and make them global citizens.

> “Givers are more blessed than receivers”

Special thanks to all the eminent sponsors, august volunteers, and all the well-wishers of the Heal family who stand by our founder Dr. Koneru Satya Prasad in carrying out his glorious mission in catering to all the needs of deprived children, believing in the quote:

> “If your plan is for 1 year, plant rice  
If your plan is for 10 years, plant trees  
If your plan is for 100 years, EDUCATE A CHILD”

We don’t call them orphans; rather, they are God’s given innocent, gifted, smiling children to whom we are passionate caretakers.

Our fine-looking green campus is surrounded by spectacular hills with the serene Brahmayya Lingam lake, one of the 2nd largest freshwater lakes after Kolleru, and has a history dating back to the Cholas.

Our strength is our 820+ children.

All co-curricular, extracurricular activities, competitions, and celebrations are given due importance.

As a team, we strive hard to bring holistic development to a child by integrating all subjects and creating a healthy environment.

Warm Regards,  
Mr. Saibabu Burra
