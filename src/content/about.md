# ABOUT US

## HEAL Society
HEAL is a UK-registered charity formed in 1992, committed to providing shelter, support, education, and health care to over 1,000 children in India.

HEAL India was established in 1993 (registration number 138/1993). The first project was initiated with the donation of a family home, ‘Ankitha,’ in Guntur, to establish an orphanage under HEAL India. This first orphanage served as a home to 26 children for about five years, until the first custom-built HEAL Children’s Village was created nearby. Today, HEAL Children’s Village provides a home and health-care centre for 225 children, along with 16 house mothers.

To expand the HEAL family, HEAL USA (2008), HEAL Australia (2014), HEAL Spain (2015), and HEAL Canada (2020) were established. These branches aim to spread awareness, engage more people, develop resources, and attract donations. Today, HEAL operates as an international charity, registered in these countries with tax-exemption status. Unlike many large charities, HEAL is entirely run by volunteers, meaning **NO administration costs**—all donor contributions go directly to the projects.

## HEAL Paradise

Work is underway on HEAL’s largest project to date—**the construction of an eco-friendly children’s village, ‘Paradise,’** which will provide a home for 1,000 orphaned and underprivileged children from Andhra Pradesh and beyond.

The village aims to be a nurturing environment where children can realize their full potential, creating a self-sustaining community rooted in the pursuit of happiness through common good. It will lead in sustainable construction, utilizing recyclable materials and ‘green’ technologies for electricity, water, sewage, and edible plantations.
